# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I have been using for the past few weeks as my daily driver, I must say it was fun
creating and using your on setup and dotfiles for the first time. It is fairly new and 
immature repo. Maintained with the help of chezmoi(great project btw), you can learn more about the amazing
project [here](https://www.chezmoi.io) and can use my dotfiles from [these](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/daily-operations/#install-chezmoi-and-your-dotfiles-on-a-new-machine-with-a-single-command) commands.

These dotfiles are not made to be worked for every system. It is just a showcase of my configs, in case
anyone finds something interesting, they can surely adopt it in their files. Still, any suggestions and
improvements are welcomed. Feel free to open an issue.

These are my wallpapers which I use, though they are part of my chezmoi dotfiles but I thought to 
separate out some images I like.
yeeeeeee! this is my wallpaper branch.
