# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I have been using for the past few weeks as my daily driver, I must say it was fun
creating and using your on setup and dotfiles for the first time. It is fairly new and 
immature repo. Maintained with the help of chezmoi(great project btw), you can learn more about the amazing
project [here](https://www.chezmoi.io) and can use my dotfiles from [these](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/daily-operations/#install-chezmoi-and-your-dotfiles-on-a-new-machine-with-a-single-command) commands.

> Disclaimer
These dotfiles are not made to be worked for every system. It is just a showcase of my configs, in case
anyone finds something interesting, they can surely adopt it in their files. Still, any suggestions and
improvements are welcomed. Feel free to open an issue.

This commit marks the most baseline workable config without any ricing and future iterations will be a
testimony of how things evolve in commparison to, this commit.

### Old description
This are the dotfile I use as my daily driver. It is managed with chezmoi, head over
to their page for learning more about how to use it.

The dotfiles are made for my personel use, hence the scripts and configurations are 
specific to my systems. It, is not that it would not work on your system (rather
I would encorage you to try it.)but it may have some broke parts. But you can configure 
it easily for your needs. The config doesn't think that you have saved few configuration files
in your custom paths but if everything is in its default location, everything should work.

### Tools used
COMPREHENSIVE list of tools that are installed and present in this dotfile can be found in 
TOOLS_LIST.md. Some comman utilites are as following.
- WM:- Hyprland
- BAR:- waybar
- APPLAUNCHER:- ROFI
